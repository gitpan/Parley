        <a id="getting_parley"></a>
        <h2>Getting Parley</h2>

        <p>You should get Parley by visiting the
        <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/projcts/parley">project page at BerliOS</a>
        or from
        <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~chisel">the author's CPAN page</a>
        </p>

        <a id="initial_deployment"></a>
        <h2>Initial Deployment</h2>


        <a id="location"></a>
        <h3>Location</h3>

        <p>For the purposes of this guide we are assuming that there is a user
        called "parley" [HOME=/home/parley/] who has never deployed the
        application previously.</p>

        <p>We'll keep as much of parley as possible inside its own directory
        area:</p>

        <blockquote><code>mkdir -p ~/parley_app/{dist,versions,user_files}
cd ~/parley_app/</code></blockquote>

        We'll use <code>dist/</code> to store any tarballs that we have
        downloaded, to reduce clutter:

        <blockquote><code>mv /.../Parley-1.x.y.tar.gz dist/</code></blockquote>


        <a id="extract"></a>
        <h3>Extract</h3>

        Then extract our most recent copy [the only one currently]:

        <blockquote><code>tar -C versions/ -zxf dist/Parley-1.x.y.tar.gz</code></blockquote>

        Making a softlink to the current version makes navigation easier,
        and will aid us later when we consider a full Apache based deployment:

        <blockquote><code>ln -sv versions/Parley-1.x.y parley
ln -sv $PWD/user_files parley/root/static/user_file
chmod -R g+w user_files
cd parley</code></blockquote>

        <p>To prevent permission errors later on, you should ensure
        that the user that runs the apache processes is in the <em>parley</em>
        group.</p>

        <a id="database"></a>
        <h3>Database</h3>

        Before we can run the application we need to setup the database:
        <blockquote><code>sudo -u postgres createuser -A -d parley
createdb -U parley -E UTF8 parley
psql -U parley -d parley -f db/parley.psql</code></blockquote>

        We can quickly check that we have created <em>something</em>:
        <blockquote><code>psql -U parley -d parley -c '\dt'</code></blockquote>


        <a id="testing"></a>
        <h3>Testing</h3>

        <p>Although coverage isn't as high as desired, it makes sense to run the
        application tests to make sure there are no show-stopping issues:</p>

        <blockquote><code>PARLEY_DEBUG=0 prove -lr t/</code></blockquote>

        <p>All test should pass. If they don't you may run into problems
        when using the application:</p>

        <blockquote><code>All tests successful, 2 tests and 169 subtests skipped.
Files=44, Tests=455, 54 wallclock secs (38.13 cusr +  2.59 csys = 40.72 CPU)</code></blockquote>

        <a id="launching"></a>
        <h2>Launching the Application</h2>

        <p>Assuming that the tests passed, you should be in a position where
        you can run and explore the application.</p>

        </p>Although not recommended for a production deployment you can
        run the application for testing and evaluation using
        <code>script/parley_server.pl</code>.</p>

        <p>In its most simple form you can start the application with:</p>

        <blockquote><code>script/parley_server.pl</code></blockquote>

        <p>If there are no problems you should see something similar to:

        <blockquote><code>[info] Parley powered by Catalyst 5.7012
You can connect to your server at http://localhost:3000</code></blockquote>

        <p>View the URL in your browser and you should see the Forum List page
        with three forums listed.</p>

        <h3>Running under apache</h3>

        <p>This is described in greater detail later in this document. At this
        point in the process we just want to run the application and explore
        it a little.</p>

        <a id="email_engine"></a>
        <h2>The Email Engine</h2>

        <p>Parley emails will only be sent if the email engine is running. The
        email engine is a stand-alone script that is launched and runs in the
        background.</p>

        <p>It polls a table for emails that need to be sent and performs the
        required magic to send them.</p>

        <p><u><strong>BEFORE</strong> you start the email engine, please edit
        <code>parley.conf</code> and edit <code>from_name</code> and
        <code>from_address</code> in the <code>alerts</code> section.</u></p>

        <p>You can start the email engine with:</p>

        <blockquote><code>./script/parley_email_engine.pl</code></blockquote>

        <p>Because the script puts itself into the background you won't see
        any output in your terminal. You can verify that the script is running
        by doing the following:</p>

        <blockquote><code>ps ax |grep parley_email</code></blockquote>

        and you should see something similar to:

        <blockquote><code>18061 ?        S      0:00 perl ./script/parley_email_engine.pl</code></blockquote>

        <p>The email engine uses syslog to log messages, which means you may
        be able to see further information in
        <code>/var/log/messages</code>:</p>

        <blockquote><code>$ grep parley_email_engine /var/log/messages
Apr 21 19:07:26 wiggin parley_email_engine[18058]: script started 
Apr 21 19:07:26 wiggin parley_email_engine[18061]: child process created</code></blockquote>

        <a id="using_parley"></a>
        <h2>Using Parley</h2>

        <p>There isn't much you can do in a forum with no messages. Parley
        comes with two users out of the box: <em>Top Dog</em>, an application
        super-user, and <a>Normal Normal</a>, a user with no special powers at
        all.</p>

        <p>Top Dog's username is <code>topdog</code> and has a default
        password of <code>k1tt3n</code>.</p>

        <p>Norman's username is <code>norm</code> and also has a default
        password of <code>k1tt3n</code>.</p>

        <p>Both users can post, read posts, search, browse, etc. Top Dog also
        has access to the <em>Site</em> menu in the menu-bar.</p>

        <a id="site_usage_terms"></a>
        <h3>Site Usage Terms</h3>

        <p>One of the first tasks you may like to perform as Top Dog is adding
        T&amp;Cs for the site. If Parley has T&amp;Cs defined all registered
        users must agree to those terms to continue using the site. ('Guest'
        users can use the site in read-only mode without needing to agree to
        the T&amp;Cs).</p>

        <p>If new T&amp;Cs are added, users must agree to those to continue
        uing the site.</p>

        <p>You can add new T&amp;Cs by clicking the <em>Add T&amp;Cs</em> item
        in the <em>Site</em> menu.</p>

        <a id="site_administration"></a>
        <h3>Site Administration</h3>

        <p>As a <em>site moderator</em> you will have access to the
        "Site&rarr;Manage" menu.</p>

        <p>This is the primary area for checking on the status of services,
        managing users and also various ban types</p>

        <a id="services"></a>
        <h4>Services</h4>

        <p>Lists known services (currently only the email-engine) and their
        current status</p>

        <a id="users"></a>
        <h4>Users</h4>

        <p>This section currently provides role-management functionality. It's
        functional, but in the early phases of development - which means it
        could be nicer to use.</p>

        <p>Select the user you'd like to manage by typing the first part of
        their name in the User Search field, then selecting the correct menu
        item, and submitting the query.</p>

        <p>You'll be presented with a list of roles and checkboxes. Select and
        unselect the options to your heart's delight</p>

        <p><b>Note:</b> you are not able to remove your own "Site Moderator"
        role. Other site moderators can do it to you, you can do it to them.
        Unless my brain is broken this means you'll always have a minimum of
        one Site Moderator.</p>

        <a id="ip_bans"></a>
        <h4>IP Bans</h4>

        <p>Unfortunately there will always be at least one bad apple. The IP
        bans are one tool in your battle against the Bad Ones. Banning by IP
        isn't a silver bullet for numerous reasons but it can stop or slow
        down some abusers.</p>

        <p>Click on the data area for the type of ban you'd like to edit and
        edit the values in the text input area that appears. The items in the
        list should be in CIDR format (<em>a.b.c.d/x</em>) format.</p>

        <p>To remove bans, edit the field and remove the relevant entry.</p>

        <p>The anticipated escalation level for bans is:
        posting, sign-up, login, all
        </p>

        <a id="additional_user_administration"></a>
        <h3>Additional User Administration</h3>

        <p>Providing you have the required roles you will be able to perform
        additional tasks from a user's profile page: <em>Suspend Account</em>
        and <em>Forum Moderation</em>.</p>

        <a id="apache_fastcgi"></a>
        <h2>apache + fastcgi</h2>

        <p>Any vaguely sane deployment of parley <strong>will not</strong> be
        run using <i>script/parley_server.pl</i>.</p>

        <p>A common (and Catalyst recommended) deployment method is to use
        <em>apache + fastcgi</em>. The process is outlined in the
        <a href="">Catalyst Cookbook</a></p>

        <p>Before going too far down this route, please ensure that you have
        mod_fastcgi installed:</p>
        <blockquote><code>sudo aptitude install libapache2-mod-fastcgi</code></blockquote>

        <a id="apache_fastcgi_configure"></a>
        <h3>Configuring fastcgi</h3>

        <p>To avoid permission issues with certain files it's recommended that
        you edit <em>parley.conf</em> and change:</p>

        <blockquote><code>COMPILE_DIR             /tmp/parley-ttcache

# ...

storage   /tmp/parley.session</code></blockquote>

        <p>to:</p>

        <blockquote><code>COMPILE_DIR             /tmp/parley-<b>fastcgi</b>.ttcache

# ...

storage   /tmp/parley.<b>fastcgi</b>.session</code></blockquote>

        <p>Assuming you have a system with <em>a2ensite</em> installed on it
        you can do the following:</p>

        <blockquote><code>sudo cp config/parley.sites-available /etc/apache2/sites-available/parley.named_vhost
sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/parley.named_vhost <font color="green"># make appropriate changes</font>
sudo a2ensite parley.named_vhost
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload</code></blockquote>

        <p>If all went well, you should now be able to visit the VirtualHost
        defined in <em>/etc/apache2/sites-available/parley.named_vhost</em>
        and find a working instance of Parley.</p>

        <a id="apache_fastcgi_troubleshooting"></a>
        <h3>Troubleshooting fastcgi</h3>

        <a id="fastcgi_permission_denied"></a>
        <h4>Open of share file /tmp/parley.session failed: Permission denied</h4>

        <p>Sometimes the fastcgi processes fail to start, and raise an error
        similar to:</p>
        
        <blockquote><code>Open of share file /tmp/parley.session failed: Permission denied
  at /usr/lib/perl5/Cache/FastMmap.pm line 574.</code></blockquote>

        <p>This is usually caused by running the application as one user, then
        later trying to run it as a different user. The second user will
        usually discover that they don't have write access to the application
        session file.</p>

        <p>There are a number of resolutions for the issue:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>remove /tmp/parley.session and parley-ttcache</li>
            <li>make the files world-writable</li>
            <li>make the files group-writable, and put relevant users in the relevant group</li>
        </ul>

        <a id="fastcgi_unable_to_store_upload"></a>
        <h4>Failed to create destination directory. Unable to store upload.</h4>

        <p>If you see the above message when trying to upload a user avatar
        it's usually a result of incorrect permissions. You will usually have
        a corresponding message in the apache error log:</p>

        <blockquote><code>/home/parley/parley_app/versions/Parley-1.0.0/root/static/user_file/0
  - Permission denied</code></blockquote>

        <p>This can be resolved (as can most file permission issues) in more
        that one way.</p>

        <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> because of the way the application was
        deployed the "offending" directory is
        <code>parley_app/user_files/</code></p> which we linked to as
        <code>parley_app/versions/Parley-1.0.0/root/static/user_file</code>.

        <p>One solution is to make the directory group-writeable and add the
        apache process owner to that group:</p>

        <blockquote><code>cd ~/parley_app/
chmod -Rv g+w user_files
sudo usermod -a -G parley <em>www-data</em>
groups <em>www-data</em></code></blockquote>
